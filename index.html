            <h1>Reproducible Papers Manifesto</h1>

            <p>If you have written a Computer Science, answer the following questions:</p>

            <div class="infoPanel large">
               <p>1. Do you want people to <strong>read your paper</strong> and build on your research?</p>
               <p>2. Do you want to get <strong>more citations</strong> and allow others to easily use your work?</p>
               <p>3. Do you want others to <strong>trust</strong> your results?</p>
               <p>4. Do you want to have access to all the <strong>code and data</strong> of other researchers?</p>
               <p>5. Do you want to be able to <strong>verify</strong> their results and <strong>see how they did it</strong>?</p>
            </div>
            <!--<h2 class="center">Then</h2>-->
            <img class="spaced" src="https://www.emailmovers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/in_luck.png" alt="You're in luck!">
            
            
            <h2 class="center">Because this is the manifesto for you!</h2>
            <p>
                    You read a great paper and have an interesting idea for a new paper that builds on the results of that paper.
                    Unfortunately, they haven't released their
                    code and their data, so you have to do all the work again. What a waste of time!
                    
                    Others will waste time doing the work you already did, and you'll waste time doing
                    work others already did. 
                </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Wouldn't it be nice to peek at the Source Code of that latest machine learning paper to understand it better?</li>
                <li>Wouldn't it be great to have access to that Amazing Dataset you saw in That Paper for your own paper?</li>
                <li>Wouldn't it be pleaseant to have a nice Notebook or Script recreating the results you read?</li>
            </ul>    
            <p>
                
                It would be amazing if others did it!
                
                To make this a reality, we must do it too. If 
                you already spent time doing your discovery, why keep it to yourself?
                
                So let's share our code and data openly and make everyone's lives easier.
            </p>
            <p>
    
                    We need to fix this. We need new ways to share our research and to do Open Science, because our
                current system is broken and makes our lives more difficult.</p>

            <h2 class="center">Principles - How to Share Research</h2>

            <p>We want other people to be able to reproduce your results on their devices
                and to build on them. How can you help them?
            </p>
            
            <h3>1. Code and data must be easily downloadable</h3>
            <p>If you want other's code and data, you must share yours.</p>
            <p>The word easily is there for a reason! 
                
                <strong>This means no paywall, no complicated procedure: 
                    clicking a link downloads the files of the whole project.</strong>
                
                If others have to respect certain constraints - no commercial use, 
                privacy regulations, or others - you can of course ask for consent first.

                However, keep this to a minimum.
            </p>

            <h3>2. The code must execute and reproduce all the results shown in the paper</h3>
            <p>If the code doesn't re-create the results of your paper, you're reproducing your results.</p>


            <h3>3. A simple script should produce all the results - no 23 step process</h3>
            <p>We are humans and humans are lazy. Make it as easy as possible to reproduce your results.</p>
              

            <h3>4. Prefer modern communication tools - avoid fax, avoid snail mail</h3>
            <p>Unless absolutely required, e-mail or web tools are much faster and easier 
                for everyone. 
            </p>

            <h3>5. Use standard and widely used tools</h3>
            <p>For example, if you want to share code, using Github or Gitlab is easier
                for everyone. It's also a lot more user friendly, you don't have to
            worry about the hosting and it makes your paper more discoverable.</p>

                <h2 class="center">Checklist</h2>

                <p>1. Is all of your code available?</p>
                <p>2. Is all of your data available?</p>
                <p>3. Is there a runnable script?</p>
                <p>4. Does the script produce all your results?</p>
                <p>5. Can you download everything with one click?</p>
                <p>6. Do you use widely used tools?</p>
                <p>7. Can you be contacted by e-mail or the web? </p>

            <h2 class="center">The easiest way to do it</h2>
            <p>You might be thinking "This is very nice, but I don't have the patience or time
                to do this. I'm a busy researcher and have other things to do. This will be too
                much work".
            </p>

            <p><strong>
                And you'd be completely wrong!
                It's actually really easy.
            </strong></p>

            <p>Here's a simple <strong>step-by-step guide</strong> to publishing your results:</p>

            <div class="infoPanel">
                <h2 class="center">How to share easily</h2>

                <p>1. Make a script that produces all your results</p>

                <p>2. Create a 
                    <a href="https://github.com">Github</a>
                    account
                </p>

                <p>3. Create
                    <a href="https://github.com/new"> a new repository</a>
                </p>

                <p>4. Click on the Upload Files button</p>

                <p>5. Add your files</p>

                <p>6. You're done!</p>
            </div>

            <p>You just shared your code and data with the world for free. You have very-high
                quality hosting and it's easily accessible by anybody. And it barely took 5 minutes.
